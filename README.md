This project detects and tracks vehicles in video streams using OpenCV and Dlib. It estimates the real-world speed of each vehicle by analyzing their movement across video frames. The system uses a cascade classifier for vehicle detection and correlation trackers for robust multi-object tracking. This tool is useful for traffic monitoring, road safety analysis, and research purposes.
