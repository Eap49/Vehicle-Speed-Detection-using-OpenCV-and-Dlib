# Vehicle-Speed-Detection-using-OpenCV-and-Dlib
A Python project that detects and tracks vehicles in video streams using OpenCV and Dlib. It uses a cascade classifier for car detection, tracks multiple vehicles simultaneously, and estimates their real-world speeds by calculating pixel movement and frame rate. Ideal for traffic surveillance, road safety, and research applications.
